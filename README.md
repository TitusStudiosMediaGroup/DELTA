# DELTA
DELTA is a static site file explorer (for sites built on GitHub Pages), using the GitHub REST API

## But why DELTA?
I dunno, It sounds cool! ..and because not many people have made a solution like this? DELTA Can also be adapted to work with blog-posts, and any other file system needs using the GitHub API.

## HEY! DELTA looks like Githubs File Explorer
Indeed it does, infact its *mostly* the same! I dont intend to keep it this way, but if you would like to keep it I might make some sort of design folder where you can select custom designs for your project, or premade ones.

> **NOTE:** The version you see on this repo ISNT finished. Yes my code is messy and may not be the best in the world. I'm fairly new to JS, "so sue me".
